                    Specialization in Computer Applications in De La Salle University - Manila and I am currently
                    looking for internship opportunities to test my skills after 4 years of college in order to grow
                    further. I am passionate about Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, and Graphic Design, and I made
                    this personal website so
                    that I may share the fruits of my passion. If you see a project you find interesting, just click on

                        <p>Sokoban is a classic puzzle video game where the player pushes some objects, trying to get
                            them to designated tiles, often in the context of a worker pushing crates in a warehouse.
                            For our Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class, we were tasked to create a bot that
                            could solve some simple Sokoban maps under a reasonable amount of time. The program is fed a
                            text file containing the containing the layout of the map in Sokoban notation. and is
                            expected to return a string of characters that denote the move sequence to solve the puzzle.
                            Sokoban was proven to be NP-Hard and PSPACE-Complete. That program is one of my favorite
                            outputs throughout university because it was daunting at the start and incredibly rewarding
                            at the end. I loved it so much that I made a GUI for it in my own time.

                        <p> As preliminary work for my thesis, I created an MLP from scratch in Python using NumPy and
                            basic OOP concepts. Honestly speaking, the main bulk of the project centered around the
                            theoretical aspect; around 85% of the work was just me calculating derivatives for
                            backpropagation. This project was super rewarding and insightful. It helped me gain a better
                            understanding of neural networks, solidifying my fundamentals before I jumped into my main
                            thesis topic. For anyone who wishes to recreate this particular project, I would say that a
                            very deep understanding of multivariable calculus is necessary. In terms of linear algebra,
                            knowledge of matrix operations should suffice; there weren't really a whole lot of questions
                            regarding eigenspaces and linear transformations involved, at least for this project. This
                            project is currently in progress and is still unavailable to view.

                            hypothetical target audience of our choice. My group decided to combine house pricing data
                            with Philippine earthquake data to create a dashboard that can aid prospective home-buyers
                            in their decision-making, allowing them to take price and safety into account. This project
